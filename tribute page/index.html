            there. What would you do, how would you fight? So you have to join
            hands, you have to take each child as your daughter. Soon you will

          ‘Savior’ to thousand of girls who were forced to be sex slave for
          years, Anuradha Koirala is a true blessing to our country. Founder and
          Executive Director of Maiti Nepal, she devoted her life to save women
          and children from human traffickers. Honored with a number of awards
          including, Mother Teresa Awards, Queen Sofia Silver Medal Award and
          Padma Shri Awards, Ms Koirala became CNN Hero in year 2010. Up until
          now, she has received thirty-eight national and international awards.
          <br />
          <br />
          Anuradha Koirala began the journey of her life on 14th of April, 1949
          as a beloved daughter of Laxmi Gurung and Colonel Pratap Singh. Born
          and raised in the hill station of Kalimpong, India, she pursued her
          education through St. Joseph Convent School where she discovered her
          passion for social work. Married at a very young age, her nuptial
          ended in a bad note. Domestic violence survivor, Anuradha had nowhere
          to go and in that moment, she felt the need of an organization that
          would help homeless women.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ms. Koirala established ‘Maiti Nepal’ in 1993 with little saving she
          had. Initially, she helped eight victims of domestic violence to be
          independent by running their own shop. Slowly the organization grew
          and eventually was backed by UNICEF. Started in a small house, Maiti
          Nepal now has multiple branches and provides an array of services. It
          has been conducting a number of activities such as women empowerment,
          social awareness, skill development and counseling since decades. It
          also provides anti-retroviral therapy to those affected by HIV AIDS.
          <br />
          <br />
          The organization does not just save innocent girls from being the
          slaves of sex market but also rescue and support those women who have
          already been through that hell. Women, returned from the Indian
          brothels are not accepted easily by society in fact by their own
          family. In this case, Maiti Nepal provides them both shelter and
          trainings until they become capable of living all by their own. In
          addition to this, Maiti Nepal has been working on patrolling
          Indo-Nepal border with law enforcement authorities and police. The
          organization have helped rescue and rehabilitate thousands of girls
          and women till date. Currently, it is operating rehabilitation home
          and an academy in Kathmandu, preventive homes in rural areas and
          transit homes at the border of Nepal and India.dha Koirala is a true
